Many great trips start with some good planning. 6 months ago my good friend
Trevor Meunier said to me, "Lets shoot eclipse in the Adirondacks on 4x5
cameras". This ticked a lot of adventure criteria boxes at once, great hiking,
film cameras, a once in a life time view, time away from the computer, it was an
easy decision. We got to planning and some time seriously passed.

Our goal was to view the eclipse from the North end of 
[Avalanche lake](https://www.lakeplacid.com/do/hiking/avalanche-lake).
Placed between the shear rock walls of Mountain Colden and Avalanche Mountain, the lake looked like a great subject and a totally reasonable (we thought) hike in.

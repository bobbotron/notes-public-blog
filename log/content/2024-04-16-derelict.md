Can we talk about how good the derelict podcast is? The antihero aspects and
deep sound design is something else. A+ would recommend if you like gritty sci
fi and driving audio. The producer does a great job of creeping pressure in the
story/scenes, they really bring things to 100, then the pressure drops off
again.

Article: [Do you find the 21st century overstimulating? Try 'longstorming'](https://psyche.co/ideas/do-you-find-the-21st-century-overstimulating-try-longstorming)

This caught my eye, I really enjoy the sentiment. The concept strikes a chord
with me, I feel like I had a touch of longstorming during my springtime trip to
the Adirondacks. Being out in the woods wonderfully disconnected from the world,
it was such a great time to contemplate where my life is at the moment, and
options ahead. I should really try to search out spaces like this closer to home
to disconnect and take a longer view. I fell off the proverbial hiking horse
after the trip, time to get back out there. Work has been quite busy; while
quite rewarding it's also been quite draining, and is consuming most of my
creative energy. How long do I want to keep doing this?

This also makes me take pause and think about being more intentional about
fostering good hikes in the woods. The temptation to bring extra electronics is
always there, but I really think there's something to properly unplugging for a
bit while in the woods.

Anyway this has gotten long, tldr [this is worth a
read](https://psyche.co/ideas/do-you-find-the-21st-century-overstimulating-try-longstorming

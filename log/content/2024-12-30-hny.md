In no particular order, here's some great media I've enjoyed this year. I
recommend checking all of this out:

- [Bad Guy by Brasstactics](https://www.knkx.org/show/the-new-cool/2024-08-16/brasstactics-celebrate-joy-in-the-grooves-of-their-new-album)
  - Brasstactics is just so fun. If you don't like them perhaps get your pulse checked.
- [Woodbine podcast](https://woodbinepod.com/)
  - Geeky vampire noir, monster of the week, great banter and set in Toronto. 10/10 recommendation.
- [Chrysalis podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/dust/id1482669176)
  - This is a few years old now but just wonderful sci fi what if story. It starts strong and rumbles though an intense 14 episodes, keeping on the pace. A tale of loss, madness, revenge and how far is too far. I'm not doing it justice, check out this great antihero story!
- [Aliens, say your prayers](https://open.spotify.com/track/4OLTCtWmUmSOYxz2qJiQaI?si=7b07286eefca4096)
  - If I ever join a band we're going to have to play this. This probably seems out of place with the rest of this but I stand by it. The [whole album](https://open.spotify.com/album/3zBmExKhhB4FvrrQRVFyf2?si=JO4duPnFR7ySHe65Sl6I-A) is a great listen; Andrey Avkhimovich is brilliant.
- [Bobiverse series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/192752-bobiverse)
  - Bit of literary junk food but I thoroughly enjoyed reading through these this year.
- [Slow Time Between the Stars](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/151908304-slow-time-between-the-stars)
- [Large format photography podcast](https://largeformatphotographypodcast.podbean.com/)
  - Really lovely, slow, deep, meaningful interviews with great, witty people.

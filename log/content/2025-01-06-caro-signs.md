During the pandemic Heather and I wrote a small mobile app for the
[Canadian Association of Rally Obedience](https://www.canadianrallyo.ca/) group.
We're currently cooking up an overdue update for the new handbook/ruleset. It's
been a fun project. Apparently this is in use quite heavily during competitions
and training.

If anyone is a react native app developer and wants to help collaborate updating
the project, let me know.

I was going to write a long post about how great the Marlborough forest is for
mountain biking, and maybe I will some day but it won't be today. I've been
having a great time biking there recently, I feel like it's a hidden gem that
blurs the line between gravel and XC mountain biking. Super fun spot, and so
many random quirks to see along the way.

Anyway, here are some photos.

I really dig how the varied the trails are. At times they turn into mild tracks through a fallow field. What's even going on here?

My Sigma Foveon sensor'd camera really didn't cooperate with this photo, so washed out. It's super dry out now but still feels a bit weird, oh well.

This part of the trail is some of my favourite, it has a great flow & vibe to it. It keeps changing and is super visually interesting. Also note the "Staging Area C" sign. I feel like things are going south if you're staging an emergency out here.

The Sigma was doing it's job here, feel like I captured a little of the beauty of the place here.

It's super old and dated at this point but this aluminum 29er works so damn well in the Marlborough, love it. I should really try my voodoo Dambala out here some day...

Never know what you'll see out in the Marlborough. Found this in the middle of
nowhere. <a data-flickr-embed="true"
